# React-Projects-Mari-Dennis

I've curated a series of React projects showcasing my proficiency in fundamental React concepts like Hooks, state management, and component structure. These projects also highlight my utilization of contemporary JavaScript functionalities such as arrow functions, array methods, template literals, destructuring, spread operators, optional chaining and more.
