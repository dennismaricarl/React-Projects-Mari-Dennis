<h4>This is a traffic light simulation project where the lights switch from green to yellow to red after predetermined intervals and loop indefinitely. Some fundamental React concepts I used to implement a traffic light simulation are 'useState' and 'useEffect' hooks. With these hooks, I managed the state and orchestrated a timer to transition between light colors at predefined intervals. </h4>
